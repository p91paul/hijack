This repository has been created to keep track of development of Hi, Jack! gnome-shell extension. I'm not the author of the extension, so all credit goes to luciangabor who wrote this code.
Please signal me if there are changes in upstream extension not reported here. You should find latest source available in review page: https://extensions.gnome.org/review/3152
You should install this extension from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/645/hi-jack/

The reason I created this repository is that this way the project, that I find useful, can survive original developer possible lack of time in the future. The author told me that he doesn't plan to create a repository, so I've decided to go by myself.

If you are luciangabor and you change your mind about publishing to a repository, I will be pleased to give you ownership of this one.
Anyone else wanting to contribute is welcome to fork and send pull requests; if I think they are useful and well-coded I will merge them and make efforts to contact the owner of the extension on extensions.gnome.org to have it deployed.

Extension Description

Hijacks the bottom of the (bottom, if there is such a thing) monitor.
The bottom right corner (and only the corner) toggles the message tray.
The bottom left corner executes, if enabled, a configured command.
By default, the custom command is disabled and can be enabled and changed from the preferences.

The preconfigured command is: xte "keydown Super_L" "key D" "keyup Super_L"
The hint is that the bottom left corner could be used to toggle the display of the desktop.

Of course, for that to work xte should be installed (yum install xautomation).
And, of course, Super+D should be configured to "Hide all normal windows".
