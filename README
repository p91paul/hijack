Hijacks the bottom of the (bottom, if there is such a thing) monitor.
The bottom right corner (and only the corner) toggles the message tray.
The bottom left corner executes, if enabled, a configured command.
By default, the custom command is disabled and can be enabled and changed from the preferences.

The preconfigured command is: xte "keydown Super_L" "key D" "keyup Super_L"

Of course, for that to work xte should be installed (yum install xautomation).
And, of course, Super+D should be configured to "Hide all normal windows".
